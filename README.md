# C4_P33_Caesar_Cipher
- ### Requirements:

  Write an app using two activities: one activity
encrypts with a fixed shift (using a **Caesar
cipher**) a text that the user types in a text field,
and the other activity asks the user to define
the shift, an integer between 1 and 25 (if the
shift value is 3, then the word `the` will be
encrypted into `wkh`. If the word is `zoo`, the
encrypted word is `crr`). Assume that only
lowercase letters from a to z will be used.
